# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `main.go` contains the HTTP server, routing, and in-memory store.
- `go.mod` defines the Go module (`rest-api`) and dependencies (standard library only).
- `README.md` documents endpoints and curl examples.
- `gin-api/` contains the Gin-based variant with its own `go.mod`.
- `rest-api` is a compiled binary (generated by `go build`); treat it as build output.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `go run .` starts the API locally on `:8080` (override with `PORT=9090`).
- `go build .` builds the `rest-api` binary in the repo root.
- `cd gin-api && go mod tidy && go run .` starts the Gin version (downloads deps).
- `go test ./...` runs all Go tests (currently none).
- `gofmt -w main.go` formats code to Go standards.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Use `gofmt` formatting (tabs for indentation, standard Go style).
- Keep handler names action-oriented (`handleItems`, `handleItemByID`).
- Data types use Go’s naming conventions: `Item`, `ItemStore`, `ItemInput`.
- Prefer small, focused functions and explicit error handling.

## Testing Guidelines
- Tests should live alongside code as `*_test.go` (e.g., `main_test.go`).
- Use Go’s standard `testing` package; table-driven tests are encouraged.
- If you add tests, keep them deterministic and avoid relying on global state.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Recent history uses short, imperative messages (e.g., “move go example to cli”).
- Keep commits scoped to one logical change.
- PRs should include a brief summary, testing notes (`go test ./...`), and any API changes.

## Configuration & Runtime Notes
- The API stores data in memory; restarting the server clears items.
- The server listens on `PORT` if set, otherwise `8080`.
