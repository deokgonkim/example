# test-router-and-history

- tested how to preserve `state` value when user navigates back using `back button` in browser.
- uses `BrowserRouter`

## result

- if the page is navigated with `navigate` and `state` option, then the state is persisted, but the page is loaded without `navigate` or `state` the initial value of `state` is used.
